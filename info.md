Attribute sensor
============================================

The Attribute Sensor integration consumes a attribute value from another entity to determine it's own state.

If the source entity provides an unknown state, it will be reflected on this sensor.

## Install using HACS

* If you haven't already you must have [HACS installed](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download).
* Go into HACS and search for Attribute sensor under the Integrations headline. Install it. You will need to restart Home Assistant to finish the process.
* Once that is done, try to reload your GUI (caching issues could prevent the integration to be shown).
* Goto Integrations and add Attribute sensor
* Follow the configuration flow
